# Time_Series_Analysis
Practising time series analysis based on the lecture from the Coursera.

Following contents are self practising python codes followed by the coursera course named 'Practical time series analysis'
The course is providing R codes, but I am trying to rerun same procedure using Python.
Thus, the contents are going to present using R (from the course) and Python (by myself).

## 1. Basic descriptive and inferential statistics

Five number summary, Standard Deviation, Histogram, and Scatter plot.
Simple linear regression

## 2. Describing a time series
